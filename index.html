					<h2 id = "about"> About Me</h2>
					<p>Hi there,  I am going to start by telling you a little bit about myself. My name is Arpan Patel.  I was born in India and moved to the United States in 2008. 
						I went to Gemini Junior High School  and Maine East High School where I learn to read, write, and speak in English. I came to the United States knowing only two languages Gujarati and 
						Hindi. Also, I did not grow up with lot of technology around me and did not use a computer until the 8th grade. I went to the Library to learn how to use a computer, get better understanding how they work and got an old computer to experiment on. </P>
							
						<p>After I graduated from Maine East High School, I attended Oakton Community College; this is where I declared to pursue my bachelor’s degree in Programming and 
							transferred to DePaul University. Formally, this major is called Computer Science with concentration of Software 
							Development. I was motivated to pursue my bachelor’s degree in Software Development because ever since I started learning coding I was hooked to solving challenging problems and it sparked my interest in learning new computer languages. By moving to the United State, it has changed my life and discovered the opportunities that lies 
							ahead of me. </p>

							<p>I am self-taught programmer and like to turn complex problems into simple solutions. I am organized person who loves to organize files, documents, folders, or any bills in a way when
							 I need to access them again it will be located without spending a lot of time looking for them. I have developed strong creative, design, self-starter, deadline-driven, communication, 
							 team environment, problem-solving, research and development skills from my Java Data Structure course where it gave me opportunity to utilize these skills. Aside from this, I  am always
							looking for new challenges and network with people.</p>
							
							<p>I have experience coding on all major platforms, including Windows, Linux, Windows App Studio, Web, and OS X. From Community College to the University, I learned to use different platforms that allowed me to learn major computer languages such as Python, Java, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4,  PHP,  and MySQL. I am also very familiar with Eclipse, IDLE(Python), Microsoft Office Suite, iMovie and many more.</p>
							
							<p>I am currently a Building Computer Technician at Maine Township High School District 207. By working at district 207, I got a better understanding of technologies in classrooms and how we can collaborate in a team to solve a complex problems. I was able to pick up some key valuable skills from being a Computer Technician is that working independently and in teams, organizing, multi-tasking and knowledge of Operating systems.When I am not coding, you will find me in the gym, hanging out with friends, playing cricket, watching basketball, baseball, or football. I am big believer in giving back to the community and help people whenever they need help. For example, I volunteer at a temple to help people with technology or teach them how to use different technologies and show them cool tips and trick. </p>

							<p>
							After graduating from DePaul University, my goal is to find a job in a company where I can contribute with all the outstanding skills I have learned through my education journey. In a work force, I would like to work as a Front End Developer/Software Developer where I can implement, test, and design software/websites that are simple, easy to use and efficient for our clients.</p>

								<p>With this seemingly endless tech boom in mind, three College of Computing and Digital Media students shared their thoughts on the technology of today–and what’s likely to come tomorrow.Earlier this year, they were among five CDM students named to the Illinois Technology Foundation’s Fifty for the Future, which recognizes some of the top technology students in the state. It’s worth taking note of their predictions; after all, these promising young scholars could very well be the next Jack Dorseys, Larry Pages, Sheryl Sandbergs and Meg Whitmans.
